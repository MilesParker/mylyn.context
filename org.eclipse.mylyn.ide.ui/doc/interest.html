<h2>Degree of Interest</h2>
<p>After you have activated a task, Mylar builds up a <i>degree of interest</i> model 
and uses this model to filter Eclipse views.&nbsp; Press the Mylar glasses on 
the view to toggle the filtering. To temporarily un filter a node Alt+click it.</p><p>

			You can also directly manually manipulate the 
			interest level of one or more elements by right clicking them and using the two 
			Mylar actions in the popup menu.&nbsp; Keyboard shortcuts for these 
			are Ctrl+Alt+Shift+Up Arrow for Make Landmark, and&nbsp; 
			Ctrl+Alt+Shift+Down Arrow for Make Less Interesting. <p>
			<img border="0" src="../../org.eclipse.mylar.doc/doc/images/0.3/interest-manipulate.gif" width="262" height="65"></p>Resources that are always 
			considered interesting can be configured to always show when the 
			interest filter is on, via the root Mylar preference page.&nbsp; 
			Note that the parent of the resource, e.g. the project or folder, 
			needs to be interesting for it's children to show.&nbsp;

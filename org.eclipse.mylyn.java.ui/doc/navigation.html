<h2>Java Program Navigation</h2><b>Show all filtered children</b><p>When you are using filtering in a Mylar view you have the option of 
			temporarily showing all children of a filtered node by &lt;alt&gt;clicking 
			a node that is not currently selected.&nbsp; For example, you can 
			&lt;alt&gt;click a source folder, keep the &lt;alt&gt; key down, and continue 
			drilling down until you find a method of interest.&nbsp;
			</p>

			<p><b>Predicted interest of errors</b></p>
			Only available in Phase 2 of 
			the user study.&nbsp; Java elements that have errors get a predicted 
			interest, which means that they show up in views such as a the 
			package explorer.&nbsp; Once the errors are fixed the predicted 
			interest goes away.<p>

</p>
			If you don't like Mylar's constant showing of Java members in the 
			Package Explorer, select the drop-down menu, then &quot;Filters...&quot; and 
			enable the &quot;Mylar Java Declarations Filter&quot;.&nbsp; It will then 
			stick in the menu in case you want to toggle between modes.<p>

			<p><b>Automatic interest filter toggling</b></p>
			By default the interest 
			filter will automatically be toggled on the Package Explorer when a 
			task with context is activated, and toggled off when the task is 
			deactivated.&nbsp; This preference is under Mylar -&gt; Java.<p>

<p>
			<b>Interest filtering for the Java Browsing 
			perspective</b></p>Interest filtering can be toggled for 
			the Packages, Types, and Members views simultaneously by clicking 
			the leftmost toolbar button visible below.<p>
